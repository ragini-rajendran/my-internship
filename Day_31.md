##### Afternoon session:

   At 12.pm we had a session with gopi who takes presentation on backend. In that session he takes class on **database** the core concept is about backend like how the data's are stored and we retrieves the data.
   first he made a conversation about what is Data. so in general a data is a collection of information.simillarly a database is a collection of data which is used to store the data,retrieve the data and update, delete a data when needed.
   **Types of database:**
   1.Relational database
   2.Non-relational database
   Relational database:In relational database a data is stored in a table format like rows and columns.relational database are used in the SQL.
   Non-relational database:In non-relational database a data is stored in the key and value format.For a unstructured data we can use this non-relational database. It is basically used in mongodb and firebase.
   He explained both the concepts with an example.
   **primary key**: a primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table.when we declare the primary key then it wont be able to create a duplicate name over on it.
   **foreign key:** a foreign key is a reference to a primary key in another table. It is used to link tables together.
   Then he moved on to the datastructure concept in which how the data's are stored and what are the different ways we can store the data.
   **1.Array:** An array is a fixed-size collection of elements stored in the memory.The elements of an array is accessed by using index.Example: arr[0],arr[1],arr[2].
   **2.Linked list:** Linked list is the list of nodes which points to the next. In linked list it is slower to access the index value.Linked list which contains **key and value** in it.
   **3.stack(lifo):** In stack the elements are stored from the top.Lifo means Last in first out.
   **4.Queue(fifo):** In queue the elements are stored in the first come first server method.
   **5.Tree:** A tree which is a hierarchical structure which stores as nodes and children.The elements are stored first in nodes under the node the sub folder children is stored.using the tree concept it is easy for the user to identify the data.
   **6.Map:** it is commonly used in modelling networks,social graphs and maps. It consists of vertices and connection.
   This session helps me to learn about database concepts very well.He explained everything with a real time examples.
