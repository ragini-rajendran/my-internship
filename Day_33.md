#### Summary on Day-33:
**Today's Goal:**
1. In my project when i clicks the content it displays the description about the content in the same page.
2.I need to add description for all the contents under the product menu.
->Initially for displaying its description i have attached an event listener to the link to handle the click events.
**within the event listener:**
->Hides the main banner section.
->Hides all other product detail sections.
->makes the content id details section visible.
->update the browser's history using history.pushstate.
->modify the popstate event listener to correctly handle the navigation back to the product id state.
after coding it doesnt displaying the description so i started working on it then i cleared the errors the it displays the description of the product in the same page itself.This is done by using the **block** in the javascript file. 
-Then i have added code for surf print in html,css and javascript file.created a div class for surf print and added its contents in <p> tag.
-In css file i styled the surf ptint contents.
-In javascript file when surf print is clicked the contents of surf touch is hidden and it should displays surf print content.Then i have added the surf pad,surf alone,surf mini,surf xpress contents and description one by one.
**post lunch**:
worked on adding the description under tap to pay iphone content.But it is not displaying its description so i have checked for the reasons and cleared the errors and after that it displays the description.The error which is made was syntax error on tap to pay on iphone.
Then completed the checkoutx softpos content and its description part.when i run the code in browser eerors happened in the checkoutx softpos.Then i corrected it.
I have completed my goal what i have set today.When i clicks the product content tab then it displays the description for each and every product.
#### Afternoon session:
At 4PM we had a session with Abraham. In that session he started interacting with the topic named **potential**.
In general potential is capacity of skill or how much capacity we hold for in that skill.for example in cricket if a cricketer is potential in bowling means he is well-versed in the bowling skill.The amount of potential is  build by practicing again and again.Each and every person have thier potential in thier own field. By making consistent practice which leads to increasing our potentail over years.
**Graph flow:** He explained potential with a graph flow representaion. In that graph the potential is described in a understandable manner.If a person is not uses his/her potential or which is unused then there is no use.without showcasing the potential thier standard will not at all increased.If a person uses his/her potential which leads to raise in thier graph.
Then he talked about **intrensic,extrensic,changable,unchangable**.
**intrensic:** Intrensic means the qualities which is inbuild and that doesnt depend on external factor.for example if a person compose music which means he/she loves to compose it in which nobody forces them to compose.
**extrensic:**extrensic means the external factors if a person likes music but the external factor like environment,genere are all extrensic which affects the intresic property.
**changable:** the things which we can able to change.for example to sing a song if we dont know the genre means we can also sing another genre.
**unchangable:**the things which cannot be changed.for example music cannot be unchanged it is already a build one.
After discussing these things he told potential is not only applicable to work but also we can apply in everyone's life.Then he talked about **money,work life quality,status,work environment,purpose and challenges**.if a person work in a company there whatever the potential will he have also when the work environment is not suits means he/she gets frustrated.
if a person doent have potential but adapted to other things also means there is no use for both the company and the employee. so for every person the above said things are satisfied the he is in the right context..for a fresher he needs to choose work life quality and the learning part rather than money,work environment because over the years of experience he can build other those things. so choosing the right context is very important  in both the personal life and in the work. In today's class i have learnt about **potential,choosing the right context,why potential is important in everyone's life,intrensic,extrensic concepts**.
