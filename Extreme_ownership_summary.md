                                 EXTREME OWNERSHIP 
Extreme ownership book waas written by **jocko willink and Leif Babin**.The book was written and inspired by three peoples Marc lee,Mike mansoor and Ryan job three courageous warriors,teammates and friends. From my understanding the word **ownership** means **taking leadership,having capability to do a work and taking responsibility.**
 The role of the leader which defines how the work has to be done,how the work should be taken forward are the qualities of he leader.
 **About the authors:** The author of the book **Jacko willink** was a US navy shield officer and chief executive officer.**Leif babin** was the chief operating officer.These two of them were worked together as a leaders and a special officers in navy. By keeping the experiences  as a  leaders in navy what are all things they learnt from that and how they won in the iraq war are narrated in this book.
 There are 12 chapters in this book. In each chapter the author describes about the stories they were experienced in the military and mainly he explains about the leadership qualities.

 **After reading the book from my understanding i have narrated what the author has explained in each chapter**.
  
  **Introduction:**
 A few takeways from the intoduction that i got were:

 - "Most leadership books focus on individual practices and personal character traits.But without a team there can be no leadership."- We have to have a team in place in order to lead.
 - "The only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails"- We have to direct the team to success.
 - "Humility to admit and own mistakes and develop a place to overcome them is essential.The best leaders are not driven by ego or personal agenda"-We have to realize its not about our personal success but the overall success of out team.
 - "Leaders must own everything,there is no one else to blame"- It is vital to the success of the team to take ownership of all mistakes.
 - There are only two descriptions about the leaders that matter."**Effective and ineffective**"
 - **effective leaders** lead successful teams to the achievementof thier goals.
 - **Ineffective leaders** do not lead successful teams.
 - The leaders ability to humble themselves,admit mistakes then develop plans to overcome them is essential to success.The best leaders are driven by staying focused on the mission and how best to accomplish it.not by **ego or personal agendas**.
 -The quote"**Everything rises and falls on leadership**" and like Jocko and Leif says in this book the leaders mindset must be "the leader must own everything in thier world".There is no one else to blame.

 **Chapter 1: EXTREME OWNERSHIP:**
 A few take aways from chapter 1 i found were:
- Leaders must own everthing in the world.
 **Leaders are fully responsible** for thier team's success or failure.
 - Blaming of others or external circumstances is counter productive.
 - **Extreme ownership**  means admitting mistakes,learning from them,and making necessary changes.
 - A friendly fire incident in Iraq teaches the author a crucial lesson about leadership. Instead of making excuses or blaming others ,he takes full responsibility,reinforcing that leaders must own everything in thier world. By embracing leaders can foster a culture of discipline and adaptability.
 - The leader is truly and ultimately **responsible for everything**.
 - On any team,in any organization,all responsiblity for success and failure rests with the leader.
 - Own your  mistakes and use them as learning opportunities.
 - **Stop blaming others** and focus on solutions.
 - Ensure your team understands and believes in thier mission.
 - "The burden of command and deep meaning of responsiblity:the leader is truly and ultimately **responsible for Everything**"-like the book's title we must take ownership...extreme ownership.
 - If an individual is not performing at the level required for the team to succeed,the leader must train and mentor that underperfomer"-We must keep a close eye out on the team at all times and know when training is needed. Sometimes we hava to make the tough call and let others come in take that person's place.
 - When a leader comes in and blames everyone else,that attitude becomes infectious and gets picked up by others on the team.They start casting blame and everyone and the team becomes **ineffective** and can't execute a plan"-This develops a negative mindset in the team and it will spread like wildfire. In these situations we end up with teams that never feel they are to blame for anything.
  - While working in a team,**plan and preparation** is very important. In that team work,leader plays a major role.Leadership is not a position or a name. They are an example for others.Whatever the work we done that may be get success or failure but the responsibility is taken by the leaders.
  - A true leader never wants to get failure in thier work.If they gets failed also they never tells reason.They thinks they must be responsible for failure and wants to handle the situation.
  - If in a team any one of the team-members does'nt give thier 100% also or if they taken wrong decision also,there is a chance to getting failed. So the good leadership's role is to gather all the team member and discuss what are good and what are bad and moves the team in a good way. so only both jocko willink and leif babin says"**Team work makes the dreams work**"
  **This chapter's core concept is leaders have the greatest impact on a team's performance**.

**Chapter 2: No bad teams only bad leaders:**
A few take aways from chapter22 i found were:
-Jocko and Leif kick this chapter off with a story of the famous "**Hell Week**" of the Navy Seals. There were two boat crews that they mention in this story. Boat crew II and Boat crew VI. Boat crew VI was consistently coming in last in thier races and there were starting to blame each other,while boat crew II was consistently winning the races. The Seal instructors decided to change the two captains out,boat crew II captain would now lead boat crew VI and viceversa. What happened was that now boat crew VI started winning many of the races. The only thing that change was the leadership.
- The effectiveness of a team is determined by its leadership.
- Leadership directle impacts performance.
- If a team is failing,its a leader's job to correct it.
- High standards and clear expectations drive performance.
- Changing a single leader can shift a team's results.
- During SEAL training,a poorly performing boat crew transforms under new leadership.This proves that leadership is not latent or conditions it is the primary factor in sucess.When leaders set high standards and foster teamwork,thier teams follow suit.
- **There are no bad teams,only bad leaders**.
- Whether a team succeeds or fails is all up to the leader.
- Set high expectations and hold your team accountable.
- Lead by example to instill discipline and motivation.
- Focus on incremental improvements to achieve excellence.
- "Success resulted from determination and will,but also from innovation and communication with the team"-We cannot afford to give up or give in.We must exhaust all possibilities and look for new ideas.Get input from the team on ideas and instill a mindset of perservance.
- "Leadership is the single greatest factor in any teams performance. The leader's attitide sets the tone for the entire team. It drives performance or it doesn't"-A leaders attitude will spoil over into a team and drives its performance. It's imperative to have a **positive mindset**. A negative mindset will result in losing teams.
- "If we could execute with monumental effort just to reach an immediate goal that everyone could see,we could then continue to the next attainable goal and then the next. When pieced together,it meant our performance over time increased substantially and eventually we crossed the finish line ahead of the pack"-**Break down goals into smaller goals**. Taking powerful smaller steps will result in more intensity and we will reach the goal sooner. Much like a snowball rolling downhill getting bigger and faster as it goes.
- "Leaders should never be satisfied. Identify weakness,strengthen them,and come up with a plan to overcome challenges"-Always improve and push to a higher standard of excellence.Build that mindset in yourself and your team.
- If we taken **responsibility of our actions** then it increases our capabilities and respect.Also if we have done mistakes then we have to accept our mistakes and finds the solution and we should know how to win that situation.
- Extreme ownership means success or failure whatever may happens,whatever the consequences may happen,the leader should takes responsibility.
- A good leader will never tells the success is because of myself only. If a failure is happens then the reason of failure is because of the whole team. 
- Likewise if success happens,the leader should tells reason for success is the  whole team.This is the main leadership quality.If the leader have this quality,then only the team player will thinks to give thier best.
**This chapter's core concept is taking ownership of team's mistake**.

**Chapter 3: Believe:**
- A leader must belive in thier mission to inspire thier teams.
- If you dont believe,neither will your team also dont believe.
- If a leader lacks belief,they must seek clarify and understanding.
- A lack of belief leads to execution and disengagement.
- The SEAL team is assigned to work with Iraqi forces,a mission that initially seems ineffective. However after deeper understanding and commitment the team successfully executes the mission,proving that belief is essential to leadership and execution.
- In order to convince and inspire others to follow and accomplish a mission,a leader must be a true believer in the mission.
- "If you dont believe in the mission you wont take the necessary risks."
- Take time to unserdtand and internalize your mission.
- If you have doubts,ask questions and seek clarity.
- Your belief will determine how effectively tour team executes.
- A leader must be believe in the vision. If the leader is not commited to the vision,well neither will the rest of the team. As a leader your commitment must be firm.
- Wolfgang von GOETHE said,until one is commited there's hesitancy a chance to draw back. It's only once we commit as a leader that we will do all the things necessary for us to make the vision a reality.
- People buy into the leader,then they buy into the vision-John Maxwell. As the leader they will buy into you first,so think about that as you lead your team.
- One other thought from me on this chapter is that once you cast vision,it actually **serves as a separator**. Once you cast your vision you separate the pretenders from the contenders AKA those really bought into the vision. Not everyone will buy into your vision.
- Whatever the "**decision**" we are taken in life that must be understood by us like why we have taken that decision and what is the reason for taking this decision should be known to us then only we will gets succeeded.
- simillarly the decision we are taking should be discussesd to others also so that they can also understand about the plan.
- If the leader takes the decision they must **believe** thier decision.If they thinks that the decision taken by them are right or wrong then it ends up in failure. so belief in our actions is more important.
 **This chapters core concept is actions must be under the beliefs**.

**Chapter 4: check the ego:** 
- **Ego can cloud judgement** and hinder decision-making.
-  Effective leaders prioritize the mission over personal pride.
-  Leaders must stay humble and open to learning.
-  The authors emphasize that unchecking ego leads to bad decisions and poor team work.
-  Leaders must detach from thier own pride,accept criticism,and focus on the bigger picture to succeed.
-  If you dont remain humble,you are guaranteed to fail.
-  Ego clouds and disrupts everything.
-  Put the mission first,not personal pride.
-  Accept feedback and learn from others.
-  Stay humble and adaptable in leadership roles.
- "Ego clouds and distrupts everything".Humility is the way forward,ego is the way backward. As leaders our power does not lie within ourselves,it lies within empowering others and its only secure leaders who empower others as John Maxwell says.
- I know most leaders are driven and motivated and thats great. This world needs more people of passion but there is a balancing act that takes place between being confident in your ability as a leader and having an ego problem.
- Many times as a leader it is difficult to see some of our flaws as the saying goes,you cant see the picture when you are in the frame. If that is you and you would like to find out more about having a coach or mentor help you achieve your **dreams,visions, and goals.**
- The ego will destroys the whole leadership quality. If ego comes to one of the team member also then it destroys the whole team work.
- The team doesnt gets the cooperation and responsibility if a team member influences by ego at the same time they never discuss with anyone and takes the  decision by thier own.Because of this ego the whole team will gets affected by its consequences.
**This chapter's core concept is don't let your ego influences you**.

**chapter 5: cover and move**:
- Teamwork is essential to success.
- Leaders must ensure all units support each other.
- Lack of confidence leads to failure.
- SEAL teams and businesses alike must prioritize collabration. When teams work together and support one another,they achieve far greater success.
- "Cover and move" it is the impportant fundamental tactic.
- Departments and groups within the team must break down silos,depend on each other and work together to accomplish the mission.
- Encourage interdepartmental teamwork.
- Ensure communication and support between teams.
- Cover and move simply means **Teamwork**.
- Groups within the team must depend on each other and understand who depends on them.
- It falls on leaders to keep perspective on the strategic mission and remind the team that they are part of the greater team and the strategic mission is paramount.
- Each team member is critical to success.
- When a overall team fails,eveyone fails.
- When a team wins,eveyone wins.
- The author says that each and every one in the **team should help each other and supports them**. In this chapter he explained this concept with a story happened in the war. In thier military operations they follow **cover and move** technique.
- If two teams working together means in that one team will go and attck the opponent and the another team acts as a security guard to protect them. After that they both gets exchanged one will acts as a attack team and another one acts as a guard.
- Like this following this technique  they achieve the success and this is the main operation of the military in theier team. soo whatever they stands in the cover or in the move they needs to keep in thier mind that the task should be completed successfully.
- In simple author says"**unity is strength**".
**This chapter's core conecept is support every team member**.

**Chapter 6:simple:**

- Life has layers of complexities,and simplifying as much as possible is critical to success.
- Complexity leads to confusion and simplicity leads to success.
- Plans must be easy to understand and communicate.
- Clear communication ensures effective execution,even under stress.
- A misssion in Iraq highlights the need for simple,clear plans. Overly complex strategies can lead to misunderstandings and failure. The key lesson is that effective leaders must disstill thier strategies into simple,actionable directives that everyone can follow.
- **"simple:** This princliple applies to all aspects of life and business".
- **"Combat: like anything in life,has inherit layers of complexities.Simplifying as much as possible is crucial to success."
- Simplify your goals and strategies to improve execution.
- Communicate clearly and concisely to  avoid confusion.
- Ensure your team fully understands thier objectives before acting.
- Plans must be communicated **simply,precise and clear**.
- If your team does'nt get it,you have not kept things simple and you have failed.
- It is critical that frontline troops are able to ask questions to clarify when they dont understand.
- Leaders must encourage this communication and ensure the lowest common denominator on the team understands.
- When we want to become a good leader we should follow onething which is called "**simpling**".A leader should makes thier plan in a simple and short manner.
- By keeping this plan in a  simple and short then everyone in the team can understand the plan.
- The author says ,in military LIFE OR DEATH is based on how we keep our plan in a simple way. 
- Then he narrated with story.When a war is happening in a military operations they cannot takes the map and discuss the operations.They have make a plan and understand the task before itself.Then only we can easily attain the success.
 **This chapter's core concept is simplify concepts to avoid mistakes.** 
 
**Chapter 7: prioritize and execute:**
- Leaders must avoid being overwhelmed by multiple problems.
- The key to success is identifying the highest priority task and executing it before moving to the next.
- Adaptability and decisiveness are critical in chaotic situations.
- Under heavy enemy fire,the team successfully prioritize thier response instead of panicking. Leaders must focus on the most pressing issue and move through challenges.
- "Relax,look around,make a call."
- "Even the most competent of leaders can be overwhelmed if they try to tackle multiple problems or a number of tasks simultaneously."
- Identify the highest priority task and address it first.
- **Avoid multitasking**,focus on one problem at a time.
- Train yourself and your team to stay calm under pressure.
- Countless problems compound in a snoball effect,but the leader must remain calm and make the best decisions possible.
- To do this,**leaders must prioritize and execute**.
- Even the best leaders can be overwhelmed tackling multiple problems at once.
- Instead,determine the highest priority task and execute,then move to the next.
- A leader should always **prioritize thier work** by keeping the important decisions in thier mind.A good leadership quality should follow these things:
1.**understands the problem:** Before getting into the task a leader should first understands the problem.
2.**plan the solution:** Need to keep a simple and clear plan.
3.**solve the problem:** Develop the plan and finds the solution.
4.**Check your solution:** Already we have fixed the target so we need to focus and execute it.
By following these rules we can achieve the high priority task. So before getting into the work we need to be prepared first is the main concept of this chapter.
**This chapter's core concept is identify your high priority tasks**.

**Chapter 8: Decentralized command:**
- Leaders cannot control every details;they must empower subordinates to make decisions.
-  Small teams with clear objectives and autonomy operate more effectively.
-  Subordinate leaders must understand the mission's strategic intent.
-  A mission in Ramadi demonstrates that decentralized command allows small units to adapt and respond effectively. Leaders who try to control everthing end up causing chaos.
- Decentralized command does not mean junior leaders or team members operate on thier own program;that results in chaos.
- Empower frontline leaders with decision-making authority.
- Ensure subordinates understand not just"what"to do,but "why".
- Build trust through clear communication and guidance.
- Teams must be broken down into 4-5 operators with a clearly designated leader.
- Junior leaders must be empowered to make decisions on key tasks and understand what is within thier decision making authority.
- **Constant communication** up and down the chain of command is imperative to mission success.
- Leaders must be free to move where they are most needed,which changes through an operation.
- Whatever the work that we are doing we have to go in a correct direction.Even we have the talent  but the success is depends on how we choose the correct path and **makes it simple**.
- Not everyone in the team will be talent.some members in a team may lag on something.
- so a senior leader oonly supervise everything and get the process done. so a good leader should takes the responsibility not by ordering the team to do the work.Then only we can achieve the goals to attain success.
**This chapter's core concept is be clear and delicate**.

**Chapter 9: plan:**
- Effective planning is crucial for mission success.
- A leader must ensure all team members understand thier roles and the mission objectives.
- Planning is key to handling unexpected challenges.
- A hard-risk hostage rescue mission is used to illustrate the importance of thorough planning. Leaders must anticipate potential obstacles and create backup strategies to ensure smooth execution.
- "The best teams employ thorough planning".
- "The plan must be communicated in a simple,clear and concise matter that can be easily understood by the entire team."
- Invest time in planning before taking action.
- Ensure all team members understand thier roles and responsibilities.
- Prepare contigency plans for potential challenges.
- The mission must explain the overall purpose and desired result  or end state of the operation.
- It is critical to utilize all assets and lean on the expertize of leaders throughout the organization.
- Team participation is required from everybody.
- Senior leaders must not get bogged down in the details and maintain strategic awarness.
- All participants must **understand the plan**.
- Those who will not risk cannot win.
- **Planning must be standardized**
- In general everyone thinks after thier decision.that why we made this decision is this right or wrong.This is called **post operational debreif**.
- simillarly in military after the task gets over,they will discuss about how they solved the problem,how better they handles the problem so that the winning makes quite easier.
- By discussing these things after the operations,they makes improvement in thier plan and ideas in the next operation.
**This chapter's core concept is debrief after every plan**.

**Chapter 10: Leading up and down the chain of command:**
- Leadership is a two-way street:leaders must lead both thier teams and thier superiors.
- Subordinate leaders must provide critical information to decision-makers.
- A united front between leadership levels strengthens the organization.
- Effective leadership requires balancing authority and communication in both directions. A successful team leader does not wait for orders but proactively communicates needs and soluton.
- "If your boss isnt making a decision in a timley manner,dont blame the boss. First,blame yourself."
- If someone isnt doing what ou want or need them to so,look in the mirror first and determine what you can do to better enable this.
- Take responsiblity for communicating effectively with both superiors and subordinates.
- Provide clear and proactive updates to leadership.
- Align your team's actions with the broader organizational goal.
- Always examine how your actions are inflencing your boss's ability to provide necessary support.
- A leader must **push situational awarness** up the chain of command.
- Realize that you may not be the priority effort.
- Always **support your own boss** and present a united front to the front line troops.
- If you don't understand why decisions are being made,it is your responsibility to ask why.
- In leading up a team ,**a senior leader should communicate or interact** with the junior leader to make the plan workout.
- By discussing with the juniors leader they can also give some ideas. By including thier ideas which leads to success.
- A leader should takes the decision based on the situation and environment. In a team,not only the leader should takes ownershipp but also the team member ahould takes responsiblity to do the work then the success may happens eventually.
- The author says,if the leader makes thier team members to understand the problem continuosly by communicating with them.
- If a team member did'nt understand the problem means that a leader should makes them to understand in a better way. This is the good leadership practice.
- **This chapter's core concept is Leading up the team**.

**Chapter 11: Decisiveness amid uncertainity:**
- Leaders must be comfortable operating with limited knowledge and adjust plans as new information emerges.
- A sniper overwatch mission highlights the challenge of identifying enemies in a chaotic battle field. the lesson learned is that leaders must act decisively despite uncertainity. The ability to process available  information,make an informed decision,and adapt when necessary is key to success in leadership.
- "There is no 100% right solution. The picture is never complete."
- "Waiting for the 100 % right and certain solution leads to delay,indecision,and an ability to execute."
- Avoid analysis paralysis;make the best decison with available information.
- Stay adaptable and be prepared to adjust strategies as new intelligence emerges.
- Train you team to handle uncertainity and remain effective under pressure.
- It is critical for leaders to act decisively amid uncertainity based on limited information available.
- There is no 100% right solution,yet leaders must always be able to make decision promptly.
- Waiting for a certain solution is not optimal.
- Leaders must make an educated guess based on previous experience,knowledge and available intelligence in the immediate moment.
- Outcomes are never certain,and success never guarnteed,but leaders must remain decisive.
**features of effective plan:**
- We have to consider the following things to makes the plan successful.
- clear vision which makes to attain our goal.
- Makes our plan in a simple and understandable manner.
- plan delicately.
- post operational discussion which helps to plan for our next operations.
**Breaks down the team into smaller**:
- In a war the team member should breaks into each group and makes a team and they fight for the war. so that the operation will be easier to handle.
- At the same time mistakes will not be happened when dividing the groups into small small team.
- In a team,if all the junior and senior leaders knows the plan then only they can get succeeded without any confusion.
**This chapter's core concept is teamwork divides the task and multiplies the success**.

**Chapter 12:Discipline equal freedom**:
- Discipline is the foundation of effective leadership and success.
- Strict disipline creates structure and efficiency,but it should not be so rigid that it limits adaptability.
- Leaders must balance discipline with flexibility to allow thier teams to think and operate freely.
- The concept of discipline enabling freedom is demonstrated through SEAL operations,where well-established procedures allow teams to operate fluidly in high-pressure environments. A structured apporoach does not make creativity but rather empowers individuals to execute with confidence and efficiency.
- "Discipline-strict order,regimen,and control-might appear to be the opposite of total freedom."
- "The more disciplined standard operating procedures a team employs,the more freedom they have to execute faster,sharper,and more efficiently."
- Implement disciplined processes that create efficiency and clarity.
- Avoid excessive rigidity-allow room for flexiblity and adaptation.
- Faster self-discipline within your team empowering them to take ownership of thier roles.
- Every leader must walk a fine line-that's what makes leadership so challenging.
- The simple recognition of this is one of the most powerful tools a leader has.
- 13 major dichotomies.
- Beyond this,there are countless other leadership dichotomies that must be carefully balanced.
- If a leader gives an order the weakest member in a team can also able to follow an order like that the order should be in a simple,clear should be  understandable even by the weakest team member.
- When a team member has any doubts they dont neglect it. They should ask the team.This will be based on the leader that how they encourges the team.
- When a team member feels comfortable with the team and the leader then they can give thier 100% in thier work.
**This chapter's core concept is provide orders that even your weakest member can follow.**

**Conclusion-Extreme Ownership:** A good leader must be have the following skills:
- confident but not cocky
- courgeous but not fool hardy
- competitive but a gracious leader
- should be strong
- humble not passive
- aggressive not overbearing
- calm but not robatic
- able to execute extreme ownership while decentralized command
- The author also says that,
 **A good leader has nothing to prove,but everything to prove**
- If a team member didnt understand the problem means then  a leader should makes them to understand in a better way.This is the good leadership practice.
- A leader should not get fear.They should be clear minded.However the situation may change but the  leader should handles the problem.
