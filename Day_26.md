3.error:code:404->it shows models/gemini-pro is not found for API versions.the model in the API url i have set in my project that doesnt support generate content. so i checked for the models in the gemini api documentation which supports generate content. gemini-pro-1.5 version that supports this package so i included this url in my project.some more errors i have cleared in my project.
###### After the lunch we have session with koushik sir. In his class he explained about 
- errors
- exception
- run  time error
- compile time error
**error**-An error is basically a mistake or a problem in the code that stops running.
**exception**-when we found the error how we handling is the exception.
**compile time error**-The compile time error occurs during the complilation process.when we starts run the program if there is an error it stops compiling.example: syntax errors are found during the compile time.
**run time error** The run time error happenswhile the program is running.after compiling when we try to execute the program something that breaks.example:a number is divided by zero is a run time error.
He explained how try and catch block is working with an example.without try and catch block the code will give error but after using tey and catch block the program gets executed with catch block statement.
