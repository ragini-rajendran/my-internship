### summary on Day-30:
Discussed about the task yesterday given to me what i searched was one of the way to get the response. It given the content what we feed in the project.Richy asked if we give a question it displays only the particular answer other than displaying the whole content. so i told prompting is important to get the particular answer.
 -> Then he explained with an example. In gemini he feed about tamil new year content. Then he prompted how people  greet on each other and the AI gave the response by displaying many informations.After that he entered other than the content which i given i dont want anything. Then it displays the required output.
  ->He also explained about **embeddings vector**.
  **example:** this is a cat
            [0.1,-0.2,0.8,0.3...]
            a feline is here
            [0.23,-0.15,0.87,0.67,0.24]
           here each word is assigned a value by default. the AI whichgives response by comparing the value of each word.this is called embedding vector.
 Then he explained about RAG.This is one of the way to get response from AI. Then he explained about the website which we cannot get access to open it. At that time how we use that website.The simplest way is just copy and paste the content of the website and store it in the database and use it.
  He asked me if URL can  be used in AI to get the response.I said yes can be used in AI.Then he told me to work on it,i tried but it doesnt working.When i gave the mcdonalt's URL in AI then i asked for the privacy policy it displays the  privacy policy in general.Then i prompted i want privacy policy which displays the content only from the URL which i given other than that it should not be displayed anything.Then it wont displays the content which i asked. So URL never works in AI.
  #### Today's Goal:
  Today i have set the goal to create the webpage or design the UI for my new project so i planned what to include in my project.
  **Requirements for designing UI:**
  ->html
  ->css
  ->javascript
  I decided to design a UI which contains surfboard payments as heading.Under that product menu is placed.When we click or hover the product it displays the following contents:surf-touch,surf-print,surf-pad,surf-alone,surf-mini,surf-express.
  #### Afternoon session:
  Afternoon 2'0 clock we have a session on mobile app development.The class is taken by joshva.I was more intersted in the mobile app development session.He started with the introduction about the mobile app development,what are all the tools were used in developing the app.
 **1.App development:** To develop an app what are all the core features should be added in the app are planned.**for example** to develop a coffee app we need to list the product and its details,payment options,delivery address are those features we need to add in our app.
 **2.MVP:** MVP means minimum viable product. It is the most basic version of mobile app that includes only core features and given to the user to check whether it fits the market and it gathers users feedback and also it saves time and money before the full scale development.
 **3.wireframing:** framing the app without coloring or designing its like a blueprint of the app.
 **4.Building the app:** Before building the app we need to choose the platform. In choosing the platform there we have two options,
         ->**native platform**
         ->**cross palatform**
A **native platform** refers to building apps specifically for a particular operating system like in IOS swift and objective c are used. In ANDROID kotlin and java are used.
**Cross-platform** mobile development means building one codebase that runs on both Android and iOS. Instead of writing separate apps for each platform, we can write the code once and deploy it everywhere.flutter and react native are the frameworks used in cross platform.
He told about why we choose flutter amoung various platforms.flutter was founded in 2015 in US.It is a open source and easy to code. It is a Single Codebase for Android, iOS, web, and desktop.Hot Reload: Instantly see code changes without rebuilding the app.
**Two types of compilation** 
->**Jit**(Just in time)
->**AOT** (Ahead of time)
**JIT** is more efficient where code is compiled at runtime,Hot Reload: Changes reflect instantly without full rebuild.He explained with an **example** like when we go to the restraurent we order the food when the food that doesnt satisfy our expectation we complains to the chef.The chef immediately alter the dish based on our requirements.Likewise in JIT also the immediate action is made before the run time but it takes more time to resolve it.
**AOT** means your source code is compiled into native machine code before the app runs. This results in faster startup and better runtime performance.Like in JIT in AOT when it not meets the requirements it restart from the scartch onwards.
Flutter which uses JIT compilation.compared to native platform,cross platform is slower.
##### APP STRUCTURE WIDGETS:
**1.Material App:** Using material app we can build the app in andriod.
**2.Cupertino App:** we can build in the IOS
**3.Scaffold:** It is like an artist drawn in the paper like a blueprint there is no color or designe. It contains only the structure. Then he displayed one simple mobile app then he wireframed the shown structures and explained step by step procedures to follow while developing an app.Based  on this example he given another app then he told us to wireframe for the given structure.
After we wrote the steps for the shown app he then discussed about what are all the steps comes under the displayed image.
**Flutter architecture:**
Framework->Engine->Embedder
**Framework** part which contains column,row,body what we did in the previous shown example.After framing we have to design it using **Engine**(c++,skia).
**Embedder** which gives access to the camera which is similar to giving permissions to access the camera.
After building the app we have to compile it to native code like **APK,AAB,IPA** Both APK and AAB are used in android and IPA is used in IOS.
#### Development Lifecycle:
1.Research
2.Design->wireframing/UI/UX design.
3.Development->writing UI(coding),Integration with backend.
4.Testing->manual testing,unit testing,automated testing,widget testing.
5.Deployment->google play console,app store.
6.App maintainence.
##### In this session i have learned and understand about the mobile app development like how it is developed what are all the frameworks are used for developing the app and what are various platforms available.The session was very intersted and i learnt new stuff.
