**postlunch:**
After the lunch i again start working on my project.I have created a new div named surf-touch details in Html file.Then i have gave the contents in <p> tag.
In css file,I styled the contents of surf-touch
To make it work,I have the javascript file in that bannersection.style.display='name'->This line which hides the banner section.
surf-touch details.style.display='block'->This line which makes the contents visible.
After it displays the content i need to go to the homepage. So in html file,i have included <li><a href="" id="home-link">home</a></li>
In css file i have included const homelink=document.getElementById('home-link');
In javascript file modified some codes when the home link is clicked after the product drop down menu is listed.
After i have run the html file in explorer it shows some errors in the console tab.Then i tried to clear one by one by debugging it.
After that i have downloaded some images for the surfboard contents to display.Then i have included in my project in the html file using the image source tag and in the css file i have modified its width and height.
Today i have finished the Goal which i  have assigned to me in the morning.for clearing the errors which takes more time to complete it.
